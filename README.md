# sveltekit_spa_daisyui_pocketbase
This project is developed based on [huntabyte/showcase](https://github.com/huntabyte/showcase), with my dream ‚ù§ choice of stacks: PocketBase, SvelteKit, and DaisyUI.
The original repo uses sveltekit - SSR mode, which needs a backend of Node.js.
If you want to deploy on a custom server without node.js, you can use this non-SSR version.


[Pocketbase](https://github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase) is witten in go and then compiled. Svelte is a compiler, too. The fastest of the two worlds!
Why using [Sveltekit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) instead of [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) itself? Mainly because of the native "routing" embedded in sveltekit. [Routify3](https://www.routify.dev/), the other solution is in beta.
